# Middleman + Phonegap Template with Haml, Sass & Coffeescript #

Middleman-Phonegap is a [Middleman 3.x](http://middlemanapp.com/) project template with the [Compass](http://compass-style.org), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), [HAML](http://haml-lang.com/) and [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org). As with all Middleman templates, using [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) and [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/) is recommended.

## Installation ##

Clone into ~/.middleman (you'll have to create this directory if it's not already there). You can then use it with the `--template` flag on `middleman init`.

1. $ `git clone git://github.com/pixelsonly/middleman-phonegap.git ~/.middleman/middleman-phonegap`
2. $ `middleman init my_new_project --template=middleman-phonegap`
